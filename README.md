## Overview

How did the domestication of sheep and goats shape the evolution of the pathogens circulating in them — both those transmissible to humans and those confined to the herd?

This repository holds the supplementary tables, data files and figures for the three research chapters that address that question. Material also published as journal supplementary information is duplicated here for convenience; the version of record is the publisher's in each case.

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 2 — PIGSTI: pathogen screening in ancient animal genomic data</b></summary>

<br>

PIGSTI (Pathogen anImal Genome Sequence ToolkIt) combines host species identification, microbial screening and pathogen authentication in a single reproducible workflow, developed for archaeological faunal material rather than adapted from human-focused pipelines. Applied to 953 archaeological livestock specimens.

| File | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `TableS1_samples.xlsx` | Specimen metadata: site, element, host species, period, accession, data source |
| `TableS2_benchmarking.xlsx` | Benchmarking against simulated datasets for ten major ancient pathogens |
| `TableS3_candidate_hits.xlsx` | All 1,023 candidate pathogen hits with screening metrics |
| `TableS4_authenticated.xlsx` | The 109 authenticated detections and the criteria they met |
| `figures/` | Supplementary figures |

> The pipeline itself lives at **[LINK TO PIGSTI REPOSITORY]**. This folder holds only the supplementary material.

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 3 — A Neolithic <i>Brucella melitensis</i> genome</b></summary>

<br>

A *B. melitensis* genome recovered from the Neolithic sheep specimen Mentese6 (Menteşe Höyük, northwest Türkiye, 8007–7863 cal BP), calibrating the divergence of *B. melitensis* from the cattle-associated *B. abortus* to approximately 9,800 BP.

| File | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `TableS1_samples.xlsx` | Ruminant specimens screened, with sequencing summary |
| `TableS2_authentication.xlsx` | Screening and authentication metrics |
| `TableS3_reference_genomes.xlsx` | The 141 core *Brucella* genomes used for comparison |
| `TableS4_diagnostic_variants.xlsx` | Lineage-diagnostic variant genotyping |
| `TableS5_dating.xlsx` | BEAST model comparison and divergence estimates |
| `figures/` | Supplementary figures |

**Published as:** L'Hôte L, Light I, Mattiangeli V, Teasdale MD, Halpin Á, Gourichon L, Key FM, Daly KG (2024). An 8000 years old genome reveals the Neolithic origin of the zoonosis *Brucella melitensis*. *Nature Communications* **15**:6132.

<summary><b>Chapter 4 — Ancient sheeppox virus genomes</b></summary>

Twenty-one ancient sheeppox virus genomes spanning the Late Bronze Age Eurasian steppe to Early Modern Europe, including the first pathogen genomes recovered from parchment.

| File | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `TableS1_samples.xlsx` | Archaeological and codicological specimens screened |
| `TableS2_screening.xlsx` | Capripoxvirus screening results and E-values |
| `TableS3_genomes.xlsx` | Coverage and quality statistics for the 21 genomes |
| `TableS4_gene_inactivation.xlsx` | Gene inactivation states across ancient and modern genomes |
| `TableS5_dating.xlsx` | Temporal signal, clock model comparison and divergence estimates |
| `TableS6_rooting.xlsx` | Root posterior probabilities across clock models |
| `figures/` | Supplementary figures |
